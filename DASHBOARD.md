## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Backend**: Express.js, PostgreSQL
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with gradient backgrounds and card-based UI
- **Data**: Real-time PostgreSQL queries

## Database Queries

The dashboard service (`services/dashboard-service.js`) includes optimized queries:

- **Total Counts**: Aggregate counts across all tables
- **Message Stats**: Time-based filtering for 7/30 day metrics
- **Response Rates**: JOIN queries to calculate response percentages
- **Denial Stats**: JSON field filtering for denial subtypes
- **Activity Feed**: JOIN queries for contextual activity log

## Performance

All queries are optimized with:
- Database indexes on frequently queried columns
- FILTER clauses for efficient aggregation
- Parallel query execution using Promise.all()
- Result caching (TODO: implement Redis caching)

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Chart visualizations (Chart.js or D3.js)
- [ ] Export to CSV/PDF
- [ ] Date range filters
