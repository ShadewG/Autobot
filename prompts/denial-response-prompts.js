            name: "Overly Broad / Undue Burden",
            strategy: `REBUTTAL STRATEGY:
1. Acknowledge their concern and offer to narrow immediately
2. Propose specific scope: primary officer BWC + badge/name, exact time window, specific location
3. Cite state law requirement that agencies assist requesters in narrowing
4. Offer phased delivery (Phase 1: essential records, Phase 2: additional if needed)
5. Reference that documentary purpose = public interest

TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:
- Thank them for review
- Narrow to: Officer [name/badge], [start time] to [end time], [location]
- Add: interrogation footage (if any) + 911 call
- Cite segregability requirement
- Offer to accept redactions (faces, plates, PII, juveniles)
- Reference state law on assisting requesters

KEY STATUTES TO CITE (by state):
- Illinois: 5 ILCS 140/6(f) - agencies must segregate and release non-exempt portions
- California: Gov Code 6253(a) - cannot deny solely on burden grounds
- New York: FOIL 87(2) - must identify specific exemption for each denial
- Texas: Gov Code 552.301 - agencies must assist in narrowing requests`,

            exampleRebuttal: `Thank you for your response. To address the burden concern, I'm happy to narrow the scope immediately.

Revised request:
- Body-worn camera footage from the primary responding officer only (if you can provide name/badge, or Officer [Name] if known), from [incident time - 30 min] to [incident time + 30 min], at [specific location]
- Any interrogation/interview footage (if it exists)
- 911 call audio for this incident

Under [State] law [cite statute], agencies must release segregable portions of records even when some content is exempt. We accept standard redactions for faces, license plates, PII, and juveniles.

This narrowed scope focuses on essential documentary footage. If phased delivery would help, we're open to Phase 1 (primary BWC + 911) first.

Please advise if this scope is manageable.`
        },

        no_records: {
            name: "No Responsive Records",
            strategy: `REBUTTAL STRATEGY:
1. Point to proof of existence (police report mentions BWC, news articles, CAD logs)
2. Request search details (systems searched, date ranges, custodians)
3. Ask for police report if not provided (this often mentions BWC/cameras)
4. Suggest specific units/divisions to search (patrol, detective, evidence)
5. Request re-search with specific officer names/badges if known
6. Cite state law requirement to conduct thorough search

TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:
- Challenge "no records" with evidence
- Request the police/incident report immediately
- Ask for search methodology details
- Propose specific search terms/units
- Cite state law on adequate search requirements
- Offer to provide additional identifying information

KEY STATUTES TO CITE:
- Illinois: 5 ILCS 140/3 - requires diligent search
- California: Gov Code 6253.1 - must assist in identifying records
- New York: FOIL 89(3) - must certify search was diligent
- Texas: Gov Code 552.301 - must respond that records don't exist or provide them`,

            exampleRebuttal: `Your response indicates no responsive records were found. However, [police report/news articles/public sources] indicate that [body-worn cameras/911 calls/surveillance footage] exist for this incident.

Specifically: [cite specific evidence - "The incident report filed by Officer [Name] on [date] references activation of body-worn camera" or "News coverage from [source] states police reviewed surveillance footage"].

To assist your search:
1. Please provide the Police/Incident Report for this case if not already produced
2. Please search the following units/systems: [patrol division, detective bureau, evidence/property, CAD/RMS system]
3. Please confirm whether footage retention periods have expired and provide retention schedule
4. If Officer [Name/Badge] or other specific officers responded, please search their BWC recordings for [date/time window]

Under [State statute], agencies must conduct a diligent search and provide details when claiming no records exist. If another agency is the custodian, please advise or forward this request.

I'm happy to provide additional details to help locate these records.`

        ongoing_investigation: {
            name: "Ongoing Investigation / Active Case",
            strategy: `REBUTTAL STRATEGY:
1. Request segregable non-investigative records NOW (police report, 911, basic BWC)
2. Cite state law requiring release of segregable portions
3. Offer to accept redactions protecting witnesses/confidential info
4. Request timeframe for when investigation will close
5. Propose timeboxed BWC (just scene arrival, not tactical discussions)
6. Emphasize public interest in transparency

TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:
- Acknowledge ongoing investigation
- Request segregable portions immediately
- Cite specific state law on active investigation exemption (it's usually narrow)
- Propose specific timeboxed footage (scene arrival, booking, transport)
- Accept redactions for witness protection
- Request estimate of when investigation closes
- Cite public interest in police accountability

KEY STATUTES TO CITE:
- Illinois: 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(d)(vi) - narrow exemption, must release segregable parts
- California: Gov Code 6254(f) - ongoing investigation exemption is LIMITED
- New York: Civil Rights Law 50-a has been REPEALED - BWC often releasable
- Texas: Gov Code 552.108 - must prove specific harm from disclosure`,

            exampleRebuttal: `I understand this is an active investigation. However, under [State statute cite], the ongoing investigation exemption does not categorically exempt all records - segregable non-investigative portions must still be released.

I respectfully request the following segregable records that won't compromise the investigation:
- The primary Police/Incident Report (basic facts, no tactical details)
- 911 call audio (already public information)
- Timeboxed body-worn camera: scene arrival and initial response only ([time] to [time]), with redactions of witness statements or tactical discussions if needed
- Booking/transport footage (non-investigative)

We accept redactions to protect witness identities, confidential informants, and investigative techniques. We consent to blurring faces and bleeping audio as needed.

Additionally, please advise when the investigation is expected to close so we can re-request full records at that time.

Documentary transparency serves the public interest, and these segregable portions won't interfere with your ongoing work.`

        privacy_exemption: {
            name: "Privacy / Victim Protection",
            strategy: `REBUTTAL STRATEGY:
1. Immediately confirm acceptance of ALL standard redactions
2. List specific redactions you accept (faces, plates, addresses, medical, juveniles)
3. Cite state law requiring segregability
4. Offer to pay additional redaction costs
5. Request segregable portions with privacy info removed
6. Emphasize that redaction â‰  complete denial

TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:
- Acknowledge privacy concerns
- Explicitly consent to comprehensive redactions
- List each type of redaction accepted
- Cite segregability requirement
- Offer to pay reasonable redaction costs
- Request segregable portions be released
- Note that public interest still exists

KEY STATUTES TO CITE:
- Illinois: 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) - privacy exemption, but must segregate
- California: Gov Code 6254(c) - privacy exemption is not absolute
- Most states: Redaction is required before complete denial
- Emphasize segregability is mandatory`,

            exampleRebuttal: `I understand the privacy concerns. We fully consent to comprehensive redactions to protect all private information.

Specifically, we accept redactions/blurring/bleeping of:
- All faces of victims, witnesses, bystanders, and uninvolved parties
- License plate numbers
- Home addresses and phone numbers
- Medical information and health details
- Names and identities of juveniles
- Social security numbers and financial information
- Any other personally identifiable information (PII)

Under [State statute], even when privacy exemptions apply, agencies must release segregable portions with protected information redacted. Complete denial is only appropriate when segregation is impossible.

We are willing to pay reasonable redaction costs. Please provide the requested records (body-worn camera footage, 911 calls, reports) with appropriate privacy redactions applied.

Documentary accountability serves the public interest, and these redactions adequately protect individual privacy.`

        excessive_fees: {
            name: "Excessive Fees (Barrier Tactic)",
            strategy: `REBUTTAL STRATEGY:
1. Request line-item breakdown (search, review, redaction, media)
2. Request file list with durations/file counts
3. Challenge unreasonable hourly rates if excessive
4. Propose narrowing to reduce costs
5. Cite state law fee limits and public interest waivers
6. Request fee waiver if available (documentary = public interest)
7. Compare to other agencies' costs for similar requests

TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:
- Request detailed cost breakdown
- Request file list to evaluate necessity
- Propose narrowing (primary officer + essential footage)
- Cite state law fee restrictions
- Request public interest fee waiver
- Note willingness to pay REASONABLE costs
- Propose phased delivery to reduce upfront costs

KEY STATUTES TO CITE:
- Illinois: 5 ILCS 140/6 - fees limited to actual costs, public interest waiver available
- California: Gov Code 6253(b) - cannot charge more than direct costs
- Many states: Documentary/public interest = fee waiver eligibility
- Cannot use fees as barrier to access`,

            exampleRebuttal: `Thank you for the estimate. To better understand the costs, please provide:

1. Line-item breakdown: search time, review hours, redaction hours, media export costs (with hourly rates)
2. File list: specific files/footage with durations and file counts
3. Which officers/cameras are included and estimated duration of each

Under [State statute cite], fees must reflect actual direct costs only and cannot be used as a barrier to access.

To reduce costs, I propose narrowing to:
- Primary responding officer body-worn camera only (Officer [Name/Badge] if known)
- 911 call audio
- Incident report

This focuses on essential documentary footage. If the estimate remains high, please consider:
1. Public interest fee waiver (documentary transparency serves public interest per [statute])
2. Phased delivery: Phase 1 (essential records) now, Phase 2 (supplemental) if budget allows

I'm prepared to pay reasonable costs but the current estimate appears to exceed standard rates for similar requests.`

Under [State statute], when an agency receives a misdirected request, they must either forward it to the proper custodian or provide the requester with contact information for the correct agency.

Please:
1. Forward this request to the custodian agency and confirm you've done so, OR
2. Provide the name, department, and contact information (email/phone) for the correct custodian

            strategy: `REBUTTAL STRATEGY:
1. Request retention schedule citation
2. Request destruction log/certification (date, authorizing official)
3. Question if retention period truly expired (often footage kept longer)
4. Request any remaining metadata/thumbnails/indexes

1. Citation to the specific retention schedule or policy authorizing destruction
2. Destruction log/certification including: date destroyed, authorizing official, and records management system reference
3. Timeline: incident date [DATE] vs. destruction date - please confirm retention period was met

Additionally, please advise:
- Do any metadata, file indexes, or thumbnails remain in your systems?
- Were dispatch/CAD recordings or 911 audio retained separately (often different retention)?
- Are there third-party copies (county dispatch, mutual aid agencies, court exhibits)?

Under [State retention statute], [body-worn camera footage/incident records] must be retained for [X days/months] minimum. If destruction occurred prematurely or without proper authorization, please provide replacement records or certification of the violation.

If retention legitimately expired, please provide the documentation requested above.`
